##Necessary packages
```{r}
library(broom)
library(modelr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(lubridate)
library(tibble)
```

##Grouping together the market cap and volatility values for each share

```{r}
# creating a function to group data according to their ticker for each fundamental
Fund <- function(df){
  df %>% bind_rows(.id="Ticker") %>%
  group_by(Ticker)
}

# map the function over the fundamentals and create a new tibble, fundamental all named Fund_all
Fund_all <- Fundamental_Data %>% mutate(FundData = map(Fund_Data,Fund))

# joining the market cap and volatility tibbles by date and ticker. Group by ticker and nest

Fund_VOL <- left_join(Fund_all %>% filter(fields == "CUR_MKT_CAP") %>% select(FundData) %>% unnest(),
Fund_all %>% filter(fields == "VOLATILITY_260D") %>% select(FundData) %>% unnest()) %>%
  group_by(Ticker) %>%
  nest()
```


## Selecting the stocks for each rebalancing date (semi-annual dates)

```{r}
# The semi annual dates are extracted from the halfyearly price data that was extracted from bloomberg
# [[3]] is the data corresponding to semi-annual dates
dates <- close_prices$data[[3]] %>% 
  bind_rows(.id="Ticker") %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  select(date)

#First I need to select the corresponding MC and Volatility values for each share for each semi-annual date For the volatility model
# This function will run through all the semi-annual dates with my tibble with volatility and MC data for each stock, selecting the corresponding data.
selection <- function(df1){
  all <- dates %>% mutate(sel = map(date,function(df){
    sel <- df1 %>% filter(date == df)
    tibble(date=sel$date , VOL = sel$VOLATILITY_260D,
           Market_Cap = sel$CUR_MKT_CAP)
  }))
  all$sel %>% bind_rows()
}

# The output:
VOL_model_Selection <- Fund_VOL %>% mutate(selection = map(data,selection))

# Now i need to group the output according to the semi-annual dates.
# Once this is done, i can select the stocks according to some specified rule (Low volatility in this case)

VOL_Selection <- VOL_model_Selection$selection %>% 
  bind_rows(.id="Ticker") %>%
  mutate(Ticker = VOL_model_Selection$Ticker[as.numeric(Ticker)])

VOL_Selection <- VOL_Selection %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  arrange(date) %>% 
  nest()

stocks <- function(df){
  df %>%
    filter(!is.na(Market_Cap)) %>% 
    filter(Market_Cap > quantile(Market_Cap,0.05)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(VOL)) %>%
    filter(VOL < quantile(VOL,0.4))

VOL_Model <- VOL_Selection %>% mutate(stocks = map(data,stocks))
# I still need to filter through the most liquid stocks based on trading volume and trading ratio
```
