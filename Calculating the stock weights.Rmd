In this file I want to calculate the weights assigned to each stock that is selected by the corresponding fundamental factor.
I'm going to use the risk parity approach.
At the ende of the stock selection process, I'm left with a tibble with the corresponding semi-annual rebalancing dates in a vector and then a list of tibbles with the selected stocks corresponding to the dates.
